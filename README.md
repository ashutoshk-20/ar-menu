## About AR Menu

AR Menu is an innovative web-based application that leverages augmented reality (AR) to transform the traditional dining experience. By integrating interactive 3D models of food items, it allows users to visualize dishes in a more engaging and informative manner before placing an order. This approach aims to bridge the gap between expectation and reality, reducing instances of order dissatisfaction.

The application is built using *HTML*, *JavaScript*, and *WebXR technologies*, ensuring compatibility across modern browsers and devices that support AR functionalities. Users can access the AR Menu directly through their browsers without the need for additional installations, making it a convenient solution for restaurants aiming to modernize their menu presentation.
